Structure Info

Schedule folded by follow structure:
  Y — Year of teaching year starting (for example 2022 — 2023 will be marked as 'Y22', then 2023 — 2024 will be marked as 'Y23' and so on):
    S — Schedule semester ('S1' or 'S2', or something else, if structure has changed):
      B — Full branch name of folded schedules (for example 'Economy' or 'General' (for first course)):
        A — Affiliation name of the folded schedules (for example 'ВЕБ' for web-development groups in 'Programming'):
          G — Schedules divided by groups. Contains full group name including formatting (like '19уКСК-2').

Don't change this structure (because it partially uses in ScheduleAPI).
