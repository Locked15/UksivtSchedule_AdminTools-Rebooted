# Admin Tools for Uksivt Schedule — Rebooted

This is a new version of [Admin Tools](https://github.com/Locked15/UksivtScheduler_AdminTools) for a schedule system.

It is still developed, so if something not working or not implemented — just wait.
Or write it by yourself, of course!

## Info

Yeah, it's still a template of README file.
It's 3:53AM, when I write it, so... just hang out.

## Dev

Currently, idea is:
   1. Create possibility to write united or standalone basic schedules from assets to last result — +.
   2. After this create function to write united file to one (like on ScheduleAPI) — +;
   3. Make possible to merge all available schedules to changes (written into another file) — +;
   4. Create function, controllers and descriptions for writing file with final schedules — +;
   5. Begin to import it to the DB. Somehow (I don't know now) — +;
   6. Create functionality to generate new changes file by template (to avoid document issues and anomalies);
   7. Integrate this to current existing ecosystem (solution).

Current step: 6.
